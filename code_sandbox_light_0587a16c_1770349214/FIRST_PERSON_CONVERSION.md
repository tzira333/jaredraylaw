## 💡 WHY THIS MATTERS

**Benefits of First Person Voice:**

1. **More Personal** - Clients feel like they're talking directly to you, not to a faceless law firm
2. **Builds Trust** - First person feels more authentic and honest
3. **Creates Connection** - "I" and "you" language creates a relationship from the first visit
4. **Shows Confidence** - You're directly stating your qualifications and experience
5. **More Approachable** - Removes the formal corporate barrier

---

## 📊 TONE COMPARISON

### Third Person (Before):
- More corporate/formal
- Describes the attorney from outside
- "Jared does this... The firm provides that..."
- Creates distance

### First Person (Now):
- More personal/direct
- Attorney speaking directly
- "I do this for you... I will help you..."
- Creates connection
