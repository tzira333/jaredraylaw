## ⚖️ LITIGATION AVOIDANCE CONTENT

### **Warning:**
> ⚠️ If you're headed-for or currently involved in any type of court proceedings, you should promptly change gears.

### **Core Message:**
> **Nobody ever wins a court case except the lawyers.**
> 
> That may seem crass, but it's the truth. Don't believe me? Go ask your friends about their past lawsuit experiences.

### **Questions to Ask Yourself:**
1. What would constitute a win in my scenario?
2. What is my budget?
3. What are my odds?

### **7 Candid Thoughts About Legal Disputes:**

1. **No Loser Pays:** There is no loser pays system in the United States. Your attorney fees will be your own problem (except in VERY rare situations).

2. **Courts Collect Costs, Not Solve Problems:** A primary reason is court cases take a LONG time. Frankly, justice delayed is justice denied.

3. **Procedural, Not Merits:** Whatever you want to fight about will likely be resolved procedurally, not based on the merits.

4. **Bankruptcy Reality:** Often, judgements go to bankruptcy.

5. **City Hall:** You can't fight city hall. Well, you can, but you better have great resolve and deep pockets.

6. **Big Business:** Big business wants your money, even if only $2.99 a month. The customers' interests really don't matter.

7. **Intellectual Property:** IP is only as valuable as the amount you're willing to spend to defend it.

### **My Policy:**
> I generally will NOT go to court - except maybe once in a while for an eviction or to collect a debt. You probably shouldn't either.

### **How I Can Help:**
> However, if I can, I would like to help you strategize how to avoid lawsuits or exit litigation.
