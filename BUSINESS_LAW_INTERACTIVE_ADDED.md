## 📝 BUSINESS LAW CONTENT

### **Title:**
> Small Business and "Corporate" Law

### **Main Message:**
> I can help you establish and maintain an LLC, partnership, joint venture or corporation.

### **Key Advice:**
> Nowadays, you can pretty much use a **limited liability company (LLC)** to handle all your business transactions. But don't just file Articles of Organization, get an EIN, and think that's all of it. You really need a proper **Operating Agreement**, regardless of whether your LLC is single owner (just you) or if you have "partners".

### **Important Considerations (5):**
✅ **Transfer on Death (TOD):** Whatever you set up, make sure it will easily pass TOD to your heirs.

✅ **Buy/Sell Mechanisms:** Create straightforward mechanisms to buy/sell - in case "partners" dispute.

✅ **Business Growth:** Make sure your paperwork allows for business growth (new and continued investment).

✅ **Documentation:** Document all actions taken. Cleanup/fix the messes that happen. Keep a good "corporate" record book.

✅ **Tax & Accounting:** You have to pay taxes and you should associate with a good bookkeeper and accountant.

### **Corporate Services (12):**
- Board of Directors Actions
- Shareholder Actions & Minutes
- Share / Membership Interest Certificates
- Amendments
- Statutory Agent Updates
- Reports & Certificates of Correction
- Reinstatements & Continued Existence
- Statements of Authority
- Denial and Cancellations
- Mergers
- Conversions
- Dissolutions
