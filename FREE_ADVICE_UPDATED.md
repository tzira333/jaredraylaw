# 💡 FREE LEGAL ADVICE SECTION UPDATED - COMPLETE

**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ READY TO DEPLOY

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS DONE

**Replaced Generic Consultation Text with Philosophical "Free Legal Advice"**

The standard "free consultation" pitch has been transformed into three pieces of wisdom that position Jared Ray as a thoughtful advisor who provides valuable life principles, not just legal services.

**Location:** About section (Free Legal Advice / Free Advice navigation item)

---

## 💡 NEW "FREE LEGAL ADVICE" CONTENT

### **Advice #1: Avoid Mistakes**
> **Getting ahead is NOT getting behind. Or, not getting behind IS getting ahead.**
> 
> **What that means** – Try not to make mistakes. Or, anyway, if you do, try to make the mistakes as small as possible. When you look back, it will be your errors that really hurt you.

### **Advice #2: Stay Out of Trouble**
> **Don't interact with "the Man".**
> 
> **What that means** – Don't break the law. Don't cheat, steal, or even speed. If you can avoid going to court for any reason, you should.

### **Advice #3: Build Relationships Early**
> **Look before you leap, or is he who hesitates lost?**
> 
> **What that means** - Befriend a lawyer when you don't need one. Opportunities will arise that you should seize. And, if you're going to act quickly, having counsel in-hand is a big plus.

### **Three Feature Checkmarks (Preserved):**
- ✅ Free Initial Consultation - No obligation, just honest advice
- ✅ Experienced Representation - Years of dedicated legal practice
- ✅ Personalized Attention - Your case gets the focus it deserves
