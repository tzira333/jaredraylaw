If you don't have jared@jaredraylaw.com:
- I recommend getting professional email

Calendly is great for lawyers:
- Free tier available
- Integrates with Google Calendar
- Clients can book appointments 24/7
- Reduces phone tag

### **3. Payments**
LawPay is legal-specific:
- Complies with legal ethics rules
- Separates earned/unearned funds
- IOLTA-compliant
- Used by 150,000+ lawyers

### **4. Social Media Priority**
Focus on:
1. LinkedIn (professional networking)
2. Facebook (local clients)
3. Google Business Profile (SEO)
